# Parenteral Medication Recognition System

A computer vision-based system for detecting and recognizing parenteral medications using a two-stage detection approach. This system aims to enhance medication safety by automatically identifying injectable medications through image analysis.

## What are Parenterals?
Parenteral medications refer to drugs administered through routes other than the digestive tract, typically via injection:
- Intravenous (IV)
- Intramuscular (IM)
- Subcutaneous (SC)

## Technical Architecture

### 1. Pre-processing
- Image resizing to correct dimensions
- Pixel value normalization
- Adaptation for uncontrolled settings/environments

### 2. Two-Stage Detection
#### First Stage: Region Proposal Network
- Identifies potential regions containing parenteral packaging
- Filters out negative proposals
- Outputs only positive proposals for further analysis

#### Second Stage
- Finely grained classification
- Boundary refinement on proposed regions
- Processing of positive cases

### 3. Feature Detection
Uses a backbone network (e.g., ResNet50FPN) to:
- Extract high-resolution features from the image
- Process visual characteristics of medications

### 4. Object Localization
- YOLO-based model outputs
- Bounding boxes with confidence levels
- Medication classification

### 5. Post-processing
- Includes non-maximum suppression
- Removes overlapping detections
- Refines final outputs

## Implementation Requirements

### Dependencies
- Python 3.x
- PyTorch
- OpenCV
- NumPy
- scikit-learn

### Hardware Requirements
- CUDA-capable GPU recommended for real-time processing
- Minimum 8GB RAM
- Adequate storage for model weights and image database

## Safety Considerations

This system is designed as a supportive tool for medication verification and should:
- NOT be used as the sole method of medication identification
- Always be used in conjunction with standard medication safety protocols
- Be regularly validated against known medication samples
- Include human verification in the workflow

## Future Development

- Integration with medication databases
- Real-time video processing capabilities
- Mobile device compatibility
- Expanded medication coverage
- Enhanced classification accuracy
